# Welcome to Metaplay UI Docs

Metaplay UI component library is an opinionated design system and a collection of UI components that we use internally to build the Metaplay LiveOps Dashboard. You can also use it in your custom dashboard components and pages to both get going faster and to provide a consistent and high quality UX for your team.

This website is the interactive documentation for how to use the tools we've made to create your own UIs from scratch.

## Large Games Need Custom Dashboards

Metaplay's LiveOps Dashboard is a powerful tool with extensive out-of-the-box functionality for visualizing and managing your game and player data. However, as your game grows, you will at some point want to add new components or whole new features into your game's dashboard. There are a lot of small details that go into making a polished UI for complex features and the best approach is to leverage as many of our re-usable UI components as possible. They help keeping things consistent as well as make it easier to cover UI edge cases like missing permissions and error handling.

For completely new designs, you can leverage our under-the-hood utilities to create new components that follow the design language with minimal effort and zero reverse-engineering.

This UI library and documentation help you with:

- A selection of battle-tested, ready-to-use components specifically designed for use in the LiveOps Dashboard.
- Overview of the design system behind the components and the key opinions we have taken with it.
- High level guides on how to use our components to build your own dashboard pages.
- Interactive documentation to understand how each component works and how they are intended to be used.
- Tests and tools to further tweak our components, should you need to.

All our components are showcased here in Storybook using "stories." These stories allow you to explore the components in various states and configurations, and you can interact with them to see how they behave in different scenarios.
