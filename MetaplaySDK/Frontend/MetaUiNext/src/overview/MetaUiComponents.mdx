# Meta UI Components

The components are organized into four main categories:

- **Primitives**: Basic UI building blocks like badges, buttons and cards.
- **Inputs**: Input component for creating forms.
- **Composites**: Complex UI elements that combine multiple components together.
- **Layouts**: Components that help you structure your content.

Additionally, we have an **unstable** category for components that are still in review and are likely to get API changes in a future release.

### Explore UI Components

Click on any component in the sidebar to explore and learn more about it. Each component includes detailed
documentation that provides a full list of properties with descriptions and default values, possible actions
and events that the component can trigger and interactive controls to test different property values and
see real-time changes.

Use the `Controls` panel at the bottom of each story to interact with the component's arguments and learn
how each property modifies the component's behavior.

Use the `toolbar` menu at the top of the page to zoom in to the component and check out the intricate details or render the
component in different viewports to see the responsiveness of the component.

### Use Them

Once you've found the right component for your use case, you can easily integrate it into your project
by following these steps:

Step 1: Import the component from the `@metaplay/meta-ui-next` component library. This module ships as a part of the Metaplay SDK package and is already available for you locally.

```jsx
<script lang="ts" setup>
  import {MButton} from '@metaplay/meta-ui-next'
</script>
```

Step 2: Use the component in your Vue template and pass in the required properties.

```jsx
MButton(
  variant="neutral"
  @click="handleClick"
  ) Action
```

You can safely use these components in your projects, as we will maintain them and provide a migration path
for any breaking changes in future SDK updates.

## Known Caveats

Our UI library is still under active development, and some regressions may occur as we continue to refine the components.
Additionally, we are in the process of migrating our legacy UI components from the older `@metaplay/meta-ui` library
to the newer `@metaplay/meta-ui-next` version.

When in doubt, only use components from the `@metaplay/meta-ui-next` library to avoid future migration work.
